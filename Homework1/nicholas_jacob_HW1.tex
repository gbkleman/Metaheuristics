\item To examine this story, we create a table:  
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
Baby Yoda Tells Truth&gurump = yes&pvlork = yes& Possible\\ \hline
T&T& T&N\\
T&T&F&N\\
T &F &T&N\\
T&F&F&N\\
F&T&T&N\\
F&T&F&Y\\
F&F&T&Y\\
F&F&F&N

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

I will assume that a sinister lying creature always lies (even though we know this too not be true eg. politicians).  

Let's examine each with our information.  We were told that the words meant yes or no so we assume that they cannot both mean the same thing.  This eliminates half of our truth table.  Next, we see that if Jedi would tell the truth, the statement cannot be.  You would not answer yes to a wrong question.  Similarly you cannot have the third entry either as you will tell the truth.  We move on to sith liars.  If gurump means No and asked if it means yes, a liar would reply in the affirmative.  This means the logic on the sixth one is possible.  We see the seventh is also possible.  Since gurump is yes and the creature lies, we would answer no or pvlork.  Thus we see that Baby Yoda is a liar.  We cannot however determine the meaning of gurump and pvlork.


\item I am going to state the problem here
\begin{quote}
A portfolio manager in charge of a bank portfolio has \$10 million to invest. The
securities available for purchase, as well as their respective quality ratings, maturities, and yields, are shown
in Table

{\tiny
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
Name & Type & QS Moody's & QS Banks& Years to M & Yield to m& After-tax yield\\\hline
A& Municipal& Aa &2& 9& 4.3\% &4.3\%\\
B& Agency& Aa& 2& 15& 5.4& 2.7\\
C& Government& Aaa &1 &4 &5.0 &2.5\\
D &Government &Aaa& 1& 3& 4.4& 2.2\\
E& Municipal &Ba &5 &2 &4.5 &4.5
\end{tabular}}

The bank places the following policy limitations on the portfolio manager’s actions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Government and agency bonds must total at least \$4 million.
\item  The average quality of the portfolio cannot exceed 1.4 on the bank’s quality scale. (Note that a low
number on this scale means a high-quality bond.)
\item  The average years to maturity of the portfolio must not exceed 5 years.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Assuming that the objective of the portfolio manager is to maximize after-tax earnings and that the tax rate is 50 percent, what bonds should he purchase? 
\item If it became possible to borrow up to \$1 million at 5.5 percent before taxes, how should his selection be changed?
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
We'll start by stating the objective function, the return on investment after taxes:
\[
P(\vec x) = 0.043x_A + 0.027 x_B + 0.025 x_C + 0.022 x_D + 0.045 x_E
\]
This is the function that we wish to maximize.

Next we examine each of the constraints.
There is a total of 10 million to invest
\[
\sum x_i \leq 10 000 000
\]

  We need a total of at least 4 million in government and agency bonds so
\[
x_B + x_C+x_D \geq 4 000 000
\]
Then we want the average on the banks quality scale to not exceed 1.4 so
\[
\frac{2x_A +2x_B +x_C + x_D +5x_E}{\sum x_i} \leq 1.4
\]
We need to make this linear for AMPL (I learned after only a few minutes of face to keyboard)
\[
2x_A +2x_B +x_C + x_D +5x_E -1.4\sum x_i \leq 0
\]
Which can be simplified to (but was not required in AMPL) 
\[
0.6 x_A + 0.6 x_B -0.4 x_C -0.4 x_D +3.6 x_E \leq 0
\]
Lastly we wanted the average years to maturity to be less than 5 so 
\[
\frac{9x_A +15x_B +4x_C + 3x_D +2x_E}{\sum x_i} \leq 5
\]
This simplifies to 
\[
4x_A +10x_B -x_C -2 x_D -3x_E\leq 0
\]
With all of this we code it into AMPL and arrive at the output:

\item 
For the second part of the problem, we add the additional condition that we can take out a loan of up to 1 million at 5.5\%.  This will change our objective function in significant ways and add an extra variable $x_{loan}$.  We examine the new objective, we will use the before tax rates and recognize that Municipal bonds grow tax free.  We also note that our total interest is subtracted from our tax liability
\begin{eqnarray*}
z =& interestEarned - interestPaid - taxesPaid\\
=& \sum_i BeforeTaxRates_i x_i-0.055 x_{loan} - 0.5(taxableIncome)\\
=& 0.043x_A + 0.054 x_B + 0.05 x_C + 0.044 x_D + 0.045 x_E -0.055 x_{loan}\\
&\phantom{    something something}-0.5\left(0.054x_B +0.05x_C +0.044 x_D -0.055x_{loan}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}
The total amount invested must also change
\[
\sum x_i \leq 10 000 000 + x_{loan}
\]
Of course there are the restrictions on the loan too
\[
0\leq x_{loan}\leq 1 000 000
\]
The rest of the constraints remain unchanged.  Running it through AMPL arrives at the solution:

\item I am going to state the problem here:

\begin{quote}
This exercise starts with a two-variable linear program similar in structure to the one of Sec-
tions 1.1 and 1.2, but with a quite different story behind it.
\begin{enumerate}
\item You are in charge of an advertising campaign for a new product, with a budget of \$1 million.
You can advertise on TV or in magazines. One minute of TV time costs \$20,000 and reaches 1.8
million potential customers; a magazine page costs \$10,000 and reaches 1 million. You must sign
up for at least 10 minutes of TV time. How should you spend your budget to maximize your audience? Formulate the problem in AMPL and solve it. Check the solution by hand using at least one of the approaches described in Section 1.1.

\item It takes creative talent to create effective advertising; in your organization, it takes three
person-weeks to create a magazine page, and one person-week to create a TV minute. You have
only 100 person-weeks available. Add this constraint to the model and determine how you should
now spend your budget.
\item Radio advertising reaches a quarter million people per minute, costs \$2,000 per minute, and
requires only 1 person-day of time. How does this medium affect your solutions?
\item How does the solution change if you have to sign up for at least two magazine pages? A maximum of 120 minutes of radio?
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

\begin{enumerate}
\item We begin by stating the objective function to maximize, eyeballs:
\[
z = 1.8 x + 1y
\]
Where $x$ is minutes of TV time, $y$ is pages in a magazine and $z$ is million viewers.  Next we set the two constraints, at least 10 minutes of TV and no more than \$1 million spent.
\[
\begin{array}{l}
x\geq 10\\
20 000 x + 10 000 y \leq 1 000 000
\end{array}
\]

We see the corner points of the feasible set as possible solutions.  We are left to find the maximum:

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}

$(10,80)$& 18+80 = 98&Max\\
$(10,0)$& 18+0 = 18&Min\\

\end{enumerate}
